Creating a website from The Odin Project. Will report back after completion to record more of my thoughts on the process.

From The Odin Project's curriculum(http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

I am making a change to make sure that I understand the whole github stage, commit, push process.

Also, Happy St. Patrick's Day!
